# Matlab Convolution Simulator

A Matlab Convolution Simulator is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool developed using Matlab App Designer. This simulator allows you to perform convolutions between two signals by entering their equations. It supports both continuous and discrete signals.

## How to Use

To use the Matlab Convolution Simulator, follow these steps:

1. **Enter the Signal Equations**: In the GUI, there are two sections to enter the equations for the signals you want to convolve. If the equation is a continuous equation, make sure to use the variable `x` and/or variable `y`. If the equation is a discrete equation, use "[" to start and "]" to close the discrete signal.

2. **Plot Signals**: After entering the equations, press the "Plot" button in each signal section to visualize a graph of the signal. This step helps you verify the correctness of the entered equations and understand the signal characteristics.

3. **Perform Convolution**: Once you have entered the signal equations and plotted the signals, you can proceed with the convolution. Press the "Convolution" button corresponding to the desired convolution type to calculate the convolution results.

4. **Review Convolution Results**: The convolution results will be displayed in the GUI, allowing you to analyze and interpret the convolved signal.
